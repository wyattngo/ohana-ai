"""Admin wiki ingest UI gate (spec 04 `04-Task-OhanaAISeller-GD0_5-InboxUI.md` §7 Phase P2).

Written BEFORE `auth.identity.require_admin` and `api/admin.py`'s guard/mount land — expected
RED until step 6. `api/admin.py` is NOT mounted in `app/main.py` as of P1 (that module's own
docstring: "api/admin.py mounting is spec 04 Phase P2's concern"), so a request to
`POST /api/admin/wiki/ingest` should genuinely fail to reach the real handler right now.

**Spec bug (flagged in the P2 ANCHOR report, not silently worked around):** §7 P2 step 1
literally reads "GET `/api/admin/wiki/ingest` với non-admin cookie → 403" — but the guarded
route is POST-only (`api/admin.py` only declares `@router.post("/wiki/ingest", ...)`); a GET
there 405s (Method Not Allowed) regardless of cookie, it never reaches `require_admin`. This
file tests the route the spec actually means: POST with a non-admin session → 403.

**CSRF interacts with this route too.** `/api/admin/wiki/ingest` is a state-mutating POST and
is NOT in `app/main.py`'s `_CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS`, so the double-submit CSRF middleware
(pre-existing since Phase P0, unmodified here) runs before routing on every request. Both core
tests below authorize first and echo the `ohana_csrf` cookie as `X-CSRF-Token` so the 403/200
they assert is unambiguously about `require_admin` / the ingest handler — not an incidental
CSRF rejection (a CSRF-driven 403 and a role-driven 403 are indistinguishable on the wire).

Note on RED integrity: an unauthenticated POST with NO cookies at all already 403s from the
CSRF middleware alone, regardless of whether `api/admin.py` is mounted — that's an existing
P0 behavior, not something P2 adds, so a test shaped that way would not actually gate this
phase's code (would "pass" identically before and after this patch). It is deliberately NOT
included as a P2 gate; see `test_admin_ingest_admin_cookie_without_csrf_header_is_rejected`
below, which is kept as a regression/documentation check with that same caveat stated inline.

Requires the same live Postgres as `test_tenant_isolation.py` — the admin-cookie ingest test
round-trips through real `Embedding` rows (CLAUDE.md §7: no mocked DB in integration tests).
The embedder behind the route is NOT a real OpenAI call — see `api/admin.py`
`_DeterministicDevEmbedder`'s docstring for why (no `app/config.py` in this repo, no
`OPENAI_API_KEY` in this dev env). Chunk/vector *quality* is out of scope here; only the HTTP
contract + chunk COUNT is asserted.
