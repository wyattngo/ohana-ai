"""Policy-gate decision logic (spec 01 Phase 5 step 14).

Pure function tests — no DB, no HTTP. The gate encodes ONE rule that MUST hold regardless
of confidence, `auto_enabled`, or shop settings: sensitive intents (complaint / refund /
price_negotiation / specific_order) ALWAYS park. This is the acceptance-blocking safety
net from spec §4 and §12 — there is no code path that lets an auto-send bypass it.

Written BEFORE `agent/policy_gate.py`; expected RED until step 15 lands.
